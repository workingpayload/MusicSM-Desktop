 * Colour maths for artwork-driven theming.

 * stays plain arithmetic on Compose [Color]s. That keeps it unit-testable on the JVM, which matters
 * because every rule in it is a judgement about how a screen should look and is therefore exactly
 * the kind of thing that gets quietly broken later.

 * Turns a colour sampled from artwork into one a whole screen can be painted with.
 *
 * A dominant colour is picked for being *present*, not for being usable: pale covers give back
 * near-white, photographic ones give back skin tone or sky, and monochrome sleeves give back grey.
 * Painted straight onto a background, all three read as a mistake rather than as theming. Clamping
 * saturation up and lightness down keeps the artwork's hue — the part the eye reads as "this is
 * that album" — while making it deep enough to put white text on.
